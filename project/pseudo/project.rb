# Draw a flowchart or write pseudo code for your final project. For large
# systems, it is better to break up things up into subsystems and draw
# individual flowcharts or pseudo code for each subsystem. The flowcharts or
# pseudo code should omit details that are not essential for human
# understanding, but should be detailed enough that someone can convert it into
# a program. Include a short paragraph describing your design.
